I would like to thank Per Thorsheim for being my co-supervisor. I do not know anyone so enthusiastic and committed to security as he is. Thank you for all support and advice you have given me. Per have given me opportunities that I would never have experienced if not getting to know him. I am going to miss all late night discussions about passwords and listening to all your crazy ideas. 

I Would like to thank my supervisor Lillian Røstad for her guidance and support throughout the project. I appreciate her wanting to supervise this project, without her, this thesis would never have become a reality.

I would like to thank my friends and family for all support. I would like to give a special thank to Agnethe Søraa, Thea Mathisen, Marthe Frogner Bekkevold, and Rolf Erik Lekang for all help and support. I am lucky having such good friends! A special thank to my friend Aleksander Gisvold for telling me about Per Thorsheim's crazy idea; the idea behind all the work in this thesis.

Finally, saving the most important person until the end, I would like to thank Håkon Åmdal for always supporting me when needing it the most.
