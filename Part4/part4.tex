	Nevne noe om hvor det står mer detaljer om pattern strength slik at man slipper å ta den samme korte oppsummeringen i hvert delkap???

	%TIME
	When creating a pattern in the survey, both time used to create a pattern and the actual pattern created was recorded. The time used to create the pattern was recorded from the start when the grid appeared until the user submitted the pattern.

	%LENGTH
	The pattern length are defined as the number of dots used to form a pattern. Each dot have a own sequence number and can only appear once. The minimum length of a pattern is 4 and the maximum length is 9. The number of unique patterns of all possible pattern lengths are described in table \ref{tab:combinations}. The pattern length are visualized in two different ways; the average pattern length and the distribution of pattern length.

	....pattern length distribution indicating what pattern length that are more often selected by the population.

	%VISUAL COMPLEXITY 
	Pattern complexity, e.g. pattern strength, is calculated from a mathematical formula that take into account the different aspects of visual complexity of patterns. The formula and parameters used are described in detail in Section \ref{sec:alp}. In short, the formula uses the size (number of nodes), physical size (length) of the pattern, number of intersections and number of overlaps. The minimum strength is 6.340 and the maximum strength is 46.807.
